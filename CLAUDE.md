## Access Restrictions

AI agents must **not open, read, or analyze** the following files:

- credentials.json

This file contains sensitive information and is explicitly excluded from access.


## Git Workflow

- Committing and pushing straight to `main` is fine. The branch protection
  ("Changes must be made through a pull request") may be bypassed — we own the
  repo and the bypass is intended. No feature branch or PR is needed unless
  explicitly asked for.
- Close GitHub issues with `Closes #<nr>` in the commit message when the commit
  fixes one.


## Project Scope / Updates

GrindingStation is an independent project for personal local use, separate from
PhyrexianArena. Application self-updates have been removed intentionally. Do not
restore update checks, Git pulls, or upstream ZIP overlays without an explicit
user request. Manage code changes manually in this repository.

The user accepts local plaintext account storage and unpinned dependencies.
CI expansion, general documentation/version cleanup, and licensing work are not
part of the current scope. Do not reopen these audit items unless requested.

## Documentation

Before a commit, README.md must be updated to reflect the current state.

## Testing

Before commits that change controller/AI logic, run
`python -m unittest discover tests`. The suite checks code correctness
(state-machine guards, AI activation logic, cast dialogs) through mocked unit
tests — it is no substitute for the debug artefacts below, which cover game
behaviour and decisions.

The suite is isolated from `runtime/` so tests do not write into the running
bot's artefacts. That isolation does **not** hang off `tests/__init__.py`:
`discover tests` sets `top_level_dir` to `tests/`, so the `tests` package is
never imported and its `__init__` never runs. Instead,
`runtime_paths._running_under_test_runner()` detects the test run from the
process's `__main__` and redirects `runtime/` to a temp directory (the line
`[runtime_paths] test runner detected …` says where, on every run).

Two traps that have already sprung here:

- **Never freeze a runtime path into a module constant at import time** — that
  is exactly what `bot_logger.BOT_LOG_FILE` did, and it defeated the redirect.
  Resolve paths at call time (`bot_logger.get_bot_log_path()`).
- **Do not rely on a package `__init__` running.** While the isolation depended
  on it, it worked by accident: `tests/test_combat_blocks.py` is the first to
  pull the package in, via `from tests.test_combat_shadow import …`, halfway
  through the run. Everything alphabetically before it wrote into the real
  `runtime/` — on 2026-08-21 that put 273 lines of fixture output (card 999)
  into the `bot.log` of a bot that was *playing*, and `test_runtime_isolation`
  (which runs later) still saw a correct environment.

`tests/test_runtime_isolation.py` checks both, and also fails if the test-runner
guard does not recognise the runner.

**Unit tests must not see the screen.** Build a `Controller` and trigger a path
that does template matching, and it really searches the monitor. On 2026-08-21
`BlindSweepTest` ran into the overlay rescue, found a Done button in the
*running* MTGA, clicked for real and died with
`AttributeError: '_FakeInput' object has no attribute 'left_down'`. It looked
exactly like a flaky test — it only fell over while the bot was running, and was
green in five repeats afterwards — and cost a round of hunting a timing problem
that never existed. Side effect: 13 of the module's 15 seconds of runtime were
real image searches (now 1.6 s). So in `make_controller` always stub
`_locate_image_center_in_scaled_arena_region` and
`_click_image_in_scaled_arena_region`.

## PR Reviews

When asked to review a PR, always also fetch and consider that PR's CodeRabbit
review comments on GitHub (both the summary comment and any inline review
comments), not just a manual read of the diff.

## Debugging / Post-mortem Artefacts

**When the user asks for the bot to be watched, babysat, supervised or kept
running while it plays — or for several accounts to be farmed unattended — use
the `babysit-bot` skill** (`.claude/skills/babysit-bot/SKILL.md`). It is the
procedure for a **long unattended run**: a Monitor on `bot.log` as the primary
signal plus a self-paced `/loop` as the fallback — because a *freeze writes no
log line*, so silence and health look identical to the Monitor. Snapshot tool:
`python tools/health_check.py` (read-only, safe even mid-match).

**When debugging bot behaviour, read the artefacts the bot writes under
`runtime/` before you read the log** — per-decision snapshots, the per-click
log, the unanswered-cast-dialog bundles, the watchdog's session records. The full catalogue, the log phrases that are safe
to grep for (and the one that silently reports zero), `MTGA_RUNTIME_DIR`, the
debug toggles, and the open, measured blind-sweep gap all live in the
`debug-artefacts` skill (`.claude/skills/debug-artefacts/SKILL.md`) — invoke
it instead of re-deriving any of it.


**The declare-attack path is the most sensitive code in the bot**: an attack
needs two clicks on the same button, and re-clicking into MTGA's animation gets
the second one swallowed. Since `06bbe3f` the press waits for the submit
acknowledgement instead of a stopwatch, and a lock keeps a second sequence from
pressing at all. It sits in the path of every attack — only touch it with
supervision and with a test. The measurements are in the skill.
