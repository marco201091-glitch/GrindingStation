# Every ROI, point and template of an ActionSpec lives in the 1920x1080 client
# reference frame -- that is the frame the templates were cut in and the
# positions were measured in. The client is not always that size: a windowed
# MTGA at 1366x768 (reported 2026-09-23, arena=(407, 165, 1366, 768)) has every
# widget at 0.71x. These specs used to be applied to the arena unscaled, so on
# such a client the boxes pointed at the wrong pixels and every 1920-sized
# template was matched against a 0.71x screen -- home_anchor.png could not match
# anywhere, POST_LOGIN_PLAY failed at step=pre_assert on every attempt, and
# Historic never queued. The Starter flow worked on the same machine only because
# it goes through the Controller's rescaled helpers.
#
# So: map every reference-frame box and point into the arena, and resize every
# capture back to the reference frame before matching -- the same thing
# Controller._locate_image_center_in_rescaled_region does. On a 1920x1080 client
# both are the identity, and the behavior is exactly what it was.
