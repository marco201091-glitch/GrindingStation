# for the very same anchors on the very same screen: when these move, one place
# has to change, not two -- the gate used to carry its own copy of a top-left
# box for two anchors that are nowhere near the top left, and refused to queue
# forever on a screen it had itself navigated to correctly.
#
# Screen-identity anchors in the top-left nav strip sit FLUSH WITH THE TOP EDGE:

# at y=20, which sliced 20 rows off it -- 0.218 in the box against a 0.84
# threshold, 0.998 over the full client area -- so POST_LOGIN_PLAY's pre-assert
# could never pass and navigation never got past its first action.

    # required_state gating would ESC-recover and get lost). Starter navigation
    # lives in Controller._navigate_starter_deck, driven purely by templates.
    #
    # Every ROI, template and threshold below was measured against the live
    # client on 2026-09-15 by walking the flow by hand and scoring each template
    # on each screen. The numbers in the comments are those measurements; they
    # are the reason the values are what they are, so re-measure before changing
    # one. Arena/client reference frame is 1920x1080.
    #
    # The two facts that shape the whole flow:
    #
    # 1. THE PLAY BLADE IS NOT A SCENE. This client only ever logs seven scene
    #    names (Home, EventLanding, ConstructedDeckSelect, Profile,
    #    DeckListViewer, DeckBuilder, RewardTrack) -- no Play, no matchmaking, no
    #    store, no options. So `post_expected_state` can never be satisfied for
    #    the blade steps and every one of them has to be decided on a template.
    # 2. SEVERAL OF THESE WIDGETS ARE TOGGLES. Clicking "My Decks" when the grid
    #    is already open collapses it; clicking Play on Home when the blade is
    #    already up closes it. Hence `skip_if_template` on each step -- it makes
    #    the flow idempotent and resumable from wherever MTGA happens to be.
